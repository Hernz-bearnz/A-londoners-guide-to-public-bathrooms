    <p class="text">You probably never thought about reading a guide for public toilets. I mean who would create one as anything but a joke?
        We would, that's who. But think about every time you've been to a toilet where it didn't flush, where there was piss on the floor.
        We hate that as much as you do. That's why we do this. </p>
